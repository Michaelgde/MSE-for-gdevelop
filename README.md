# MSE (Music Sheet Editor) for GDevelop

## About

MSE is a music mapping tool for GDevelop designed to track and key beats in audio/music. Itâ€™s particularly useful for creating rhythm games like **Friday Night Funkin' (FNF)**, **Geometry Dash**, **Guitar Hero**, and other similar games.

MSE saves the keys you map in JSON files. These files can be converted into an array/structure variable in GDevelop using the "JSON to Variable" extension.

## Plugins

Plugins are third-party features that extend the functionality of MSE. Plugins are written in JavaScript using the **GDJS** (GDevelop JavaScript) library.

For documentation on **GDJS**, visit:  
[GDJS Documentation](https://docs.gdevelop.io/GDJS%20Runtime%20Documentation/modules/gdjs.html)

## How to Use MSE

1. **Creating Keys**: Press **C** to create a key at the current position on the grid. The grid represents the beats per minute (BPM) where each grid line corresponds to a beat.
2. **TA (Time of Audio)**: The long moving line in the editor represents the **Time of Audio (TA)**. It graphically indicates when a key is reached, a note is played, or when an event can be triggered in sync with the audio.
3. **Exporting Data**:
   - **Array Export**: You can export your project as an array. This format is useful if you only need the time when a note/key is reached or the X position of a key, which helps to reduce the size of the JSON file.
   - **Structure Export**: You can export your project as a structure. This format includes all data such as time, X position, Y position, and events.
4. **Scripts**: Developers can use the **Script** feature to run custom JavaScript, mainly using GDJS. This allows further customization and improvement of MSE.
