# MSE (Music Sheet Editor) for gdevelop Documentation
# About
MSE is a music mapper for gdevelop use to track and key beats in an audio/music it can be used for making FNF, Geometry dash, Guitar hero and much more rythm games.
It saves keys you mapped in  json files which with the json to variable extension in gdevelop can be converted to a array/structure variable
# plugins
Plugins are third party features that can be added to MSE.
They are written using JavaScript with a library called GDJS(gdevelop Javascript).
visit here for documentation on GDJS https://docs.gdevelop.io/GDJS%20Runtime%20Documentation/modules/gdjs.html
To publish a plugin reach out to me at my discord server https://discord.gg/BqMsVZ2mR8
# How to use mse
* press c to create key at grid the cursor is at, the grid represents the bpm where a each grid can be a beat
* The long line that moves as the music/audio is played is called TA(time of audio) this graphically represent when a key is reached or when note is played or when an event can be triggered in the audio
* You can export your project as an array but it is only usefull if you just need only the time a note/key is reached/played or if you just need the x position of a key this helps to reduce size of json
* You can export your project as a structure this export all data like time/x position, y position and events
* script is a great tool for devs trying to make MSE better it can execute scripts written in javascript mainly GDJS
